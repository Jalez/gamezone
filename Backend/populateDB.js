      content: `<div>
      <p>Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics, including motor skills and other psycho-physiological processes; cognitive development involving areas such as problem solving, moral understanding, and conceptual understanding; language acquisition; social, personality, and emotional development; and self-concept and identity formation.</p>

      <p>This is the introduction to the first chapter. This chapter is about the basics of development. It covers the definition of development, the context of development, and the nature of development. It also discusses the history of developmental psychology and the major theories of development. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the research methods used in the study of development.

      title: "Defining Development",
      author: "",
      content: `<div>
      <p>We define development as the progressive series of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes that occur from conception to death. Development is a lifelong process that begins before birth and continues until we die. It involves both growth and decline, as well as gains and losses. Development is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and culture. It is also a dynamic process that is shaped by the interactions between individuals and their environments. Development is a universal process that occurs in all individuals, but it is also an individual process that is unique to each person.

      <h2>What is Psychology?</h2>


      <p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as human development
      , sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. Psychology is really a very new science, with most advances happening over the past 150 years or so. However, its origins can be traced back to ancient Greece, 400 â€“ 500 years BC. The emphasis was a philosophical one, with great thinkers such as Socrates influencing Plato, who in turn influenced Aristotle. The emphasis of the early Greek philosophers was the relationship between mind and body, the so-called mind-body duality. One of the key questions that still fascinates psychologists today is how the mind and body interact.</p>
